            <h3>Firewall</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="fw-content">
            <h5>Firewall configuration steps can vary depending on the specific firewall product you are using. However, here are some general steps to follow when configuring a firewall:</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="fw-content2">
            <p>    <span>1. Secure your firewall:</span>  If an attacker is able to gain administrative access to your firewall it is “game over” for your network security. Therefore, securing your firewall is the first and most important step of this process  Never put a firewall into production that is not properly secured by at least the following configuration actions:

                Update your firewall to the latest firmware.
                
                Delete, disable, or rename any default user accounts and change all default passwords. Make sure to use only complex and secure passwords.
                If multiple administrators will manage the firewall, create additional administrator accounts with limited privileges based on responsibilities. Never use shared user accounts.
                Disable simple network management protocol (SNMP) or configure it to use a secure community string. <br>
                <br> <span>2. Architect your firewall zones and IP addresses:</span> To protect your network's important assets, you must first define what the assets are (for example, payment card data or patient data). Then design your network structure so that these assets can be grouped together and assigned to networks (or zones) based on sensitivity level and function.  

                For example, all of your servers that provide internet-based services (web servers, email servers, virtual private network (VPN) servers, and so on) should be housed in a dedicated zone that allows only limited inbound traffic from the internet (this zone is sometimes referred to as a demilitarized zone or DMZ). Database servers, for example, should not be accessed directly from the internet and should instead be put in internal server zones. Similarly, workstations Internal network zones are typically used for point-of-sale devices and voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) systems. 

                In general, the more zones you build, the more secure your network will be. However, keep in mind that managing more zones takes more time and resources, so be cautious when deciding how many network zones to use.
                Internal IP addresses should be used for all internal networks if you are utilizing IP version 4. When necessary, network address translation (NAT) must be established to allow internal devices to communicate on the Internet.
                You're ready to construct firewall zones and assign them to your network once you've built your network zone structure and established the relevant IP address scheme Firewall interfaces are sometimes known as subinterfaces. Switches that support virtual LANs (VLANs) should be used to ensure level-2 separation between networks as you build up your network infrastructure.<br>
    
                <br> <span>3. Configure access control lists:</span> Now that you have established your network zones and assigned them to interfaces, you should determine exactly which traffic needs to be able to flow into and out of each zone.

                This traffic will be permitted using firewall rules called access control lists (ACLs), which are applied to each interface or subinterface on the firewall. Make your ACLs specific to the exact source and/or destination IP addresses and port numbers whenever possible. At the end of every access control list, make sure there is a “deny all” rule to filter out all unapproved traffic. Apply both inbound and outbound ACLs to each interface and subinterface on your firewall so that only approved traffic is allowed into and out of each zone.
                
                Whenever possible, it is generally advised to disable your firewall administration interfaces (including both secure shell (SSH) and web interfaces) from public access. This will help to protect your firewall configuration from outside threats. Make sure to disable all unencrypted protocols for firewall management, including Telnet and HTTP connections. <br>   
    
                <br> <span>4. Configure your other firewall services and logging:</span> If your firewall is also capable of acting as a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server, network time protocol (NTP) server, intrusion prevention system (IPS), etc., then go ahead and configure the services you wish to use. Disable all the extra services that you don’t intend to use. 

                To fulfill PCI DSS requirements, configure your firewall to report to your logging server, and make sure that enough detail is included to satisfy requirement 10.2 through 10.3 of the PCI DSS. <br>
    
                <br> <span>5. Test your firewall configuration:</span> In a test environment, verify that your firewall works as intended. Don’t forget to verify that your firewall is blocking traffic that should be blocked according to your ACL configurations.  Testing your firewall should include both vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.

                Once you have finished testing your firewall, your firewall should be ready for production. Always remember to keep a backup of your firewall configuration saved in a secure place so that all of your hard work is not lost in the event of a hardware failure.
                
                Remember, this is just an overview to help you understand the major steps of firewall configuration. When using tutorials, or even if you decide to configure your own firewall, be sure to have a security expert review your configuration to make sure it is set up to keep your data as safe as possible. <br>
